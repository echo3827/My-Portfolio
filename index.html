        <h1> My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>My name is Elma Chowdhury and I am a 17 year old high school student. I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison located in Queens, New York. I am a web design student and I am currently mainly informed on CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I plant to enhance my knowledge on several different coding languages in order to be able to create websites using my full potential. You can contact me through my email: echo3827@taehs.org </p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://echo3827.github.io/randomquote/">Random Quote Generator</a></h3>
        <p>In this project I created a webpage that shows a random motivational quote when the a button is clicked. Within the website, the user is expected to click a button that is labeled as "Generate Random Quote", upon clicking this button, the user will be presented with a motivational quote.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://echo3827.github.io/characterquiz/">Character Quiz</a></h3>
        <p>In this project I used conditional statements to create a Character Quiz based off the show "Avatar The Last Airbender". Within this website, the user is asked a series of questions which upon answering will gather information on their answers and draw a conclusion based off of that, then they will be presented with which character the website believes best fits their personality.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://echo3827.github.io/Favorite-Foods/">Photo Gallery</a></h3>
        <p>In this project I applied my knowledge on arrays and loops in order to create a photo gallery of some of my favorite foods. Within this website, the user is also able to add their own link into a search bar and upon hitting search, their links picture is added onto the website besides the pictures I personally put in myself.</p>
